    Currently, the swarm and the kubernetes drivers use
    a dedicated cinder volume to store the container
    images. It was been observed that one cinder volume
    per node is a bottleneck for large clusters.
fixes:
  - Make the dedicated cinder volume per node an opt-in
    option. By default, no cinder volumes will be created
    unless the user passes the docker-volume-size argument.
